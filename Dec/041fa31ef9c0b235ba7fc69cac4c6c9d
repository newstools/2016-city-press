Hlaudi Motsoeneng dominated headlines this year and with that dominance came a big microphone (not that he needed it). S’thembile Cele picks of the best Hlaudisms that we heard from the embattled former SABC chief operations officer. 1. “Hlaudi will never have stress. I’m a different animal. In South Africa I have more majority. Everywhere I go people support Hlaudi, worse in the rural area because I am a rural boy and I am here to change the mindset of the people believing that if you come from rural, you can’t achieve.” 2. “Hlaudi Motsoeneng is Hlaudi Motsoeneng and there is only one Hlaudi in South Africa, no one else.” 3. “I am also aware that I am selling newspapers. You run with Hlaudi, your newspapers, before 10:00 they are gone because Hlaudi is a brand. You go to social media, Hlaudi is trending, number 1, number 2, number 3. I am making money for you.” 4. “Should I go back to school? The answer is a big no.” 5. “You know when people talk about transformation, they speak English. I don’t speak English, I speak implementation.” 6. “I have been thinking maybe our employees should have uniforms so that they can understand unity.” 7. “Some leaders are born. Like myself, I am a born leader, so you can’t take that away from me. I have been leading from a young age. From Standard 3 I was a leader, even leading my own teachers.” 8. “When you read the Bible, all people didn’t believe that Jesus Christ was there to save them. I’m here to save South Africa.” * Catch up by reading City Press's special investigation into the SABC.
