The ANC Women’s League has lashed out at Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema regarding comments that African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma would be no better than President Jacob Zuma should she succeed him. Malema remarked that Zuma wants his ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to succeed him in order to continue the Zuma legacy. “[This portrays] Cde Nkosazana as nothing else but a person who is at the mercy of President Zuma with no capacity to lead. This reduces women to be living under the shadows of males and in dire need of blessings from males to ascend to positions of power," said the league. “Through this narrative, Julius has displayed the highest level in undermining women's capabilities to lead in society…views from patriarchist of high note.” Malema had also made comments earlier in May this year when Dlamini-Zuma received the award for South African of the Year from the Guptas, saying she had destroyed her credentials by accepting it. “The [ex-]wife of Zuma, she is worse. The [Gupta] security said Dlamini-Zuma frequents this house like she has her own room,” Malema said at a dinner after the launch of the EFF’s election manifesto for the coming local government elections. The women's league went on to say that Malema’s bitterness was based on his expulsion from the ANC and that it wouldn't be drawn into an ANC succession debate. “No mandate will be derived from members of any political [party] … any person whom ANC members feel is capable to lead will be discussed through the structures of the ANC.” Full statement:
