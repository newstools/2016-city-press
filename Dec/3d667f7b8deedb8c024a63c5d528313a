Today is New Year's Eve with many of us hosting or attending braais, and this means that there will be food aplenty. If you’re stuck for ideas as to what to make for your appetisers or starters, why not try some of these recipes below? They’re easy on the wallet and will be a great hit with the guests! Cheesy nachos Yes, nachos are easy to make and can be served as a meat or vegetarian dish. I made this for my birthday earlier this year and, needless to say, my guests loved them! Ingredients 2 ripe avocados 1 tub of spring onion and chives cream cheese 500g cheddar cheese 1 bag of plain nachos 15ml lemon juice Salt and pepper for flavouring (Chicken strips for the meat option, pre-cooked) Method Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius Spread the nachos into an oven proof glass or metal dish (Add pre-cooked chicken strips) Grate the cheese and generously sprinkle over nachos Place in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese the melted While the nachos are in the oven, peel the avocado and slice thinly. In a bowl, add lemon juice, salt and pepper and mash the avocados until thick in consistency. Remove the cream cheese and add to a separate bowl. Your nachos are now ready to be served with a dollop or cream cheese and avocado. Crispy roll with cream cheese topping This is even easier than the nachos, and will take you only 10 minutes to prepare (depending on how good your bread slicing skills are). I made this for my boyfriend’s birthday last week, and boy did they fly like hot cakes! Ingredients Long crispy rolls x 2 One tub or cream cheese (flavouring of your choice) Method Slice the bread into 1.5cm thick pieces, diagonally, as this creates longer slices. Spread the cheese on to the slices and lay into a tray. Voila! Delicious easy to eat starters which leaves room for a drink in the other hand.
