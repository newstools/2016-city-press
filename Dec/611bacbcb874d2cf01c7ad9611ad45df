If you have over-indulged this festive season and can feel
your pants size slowly tightening around your waist, this will make you feel
better. Work off those festive kilos with City Press’s Mohau
Mokoena. This high-interval training routine, which includes a combination of
skipping and body-weight training, can be done at home. The best part is that
it only takes 10 minutes and doesn’t require any equipment other than a
skipping rope.  *Disclaimer* Please consult your doctor before attempting any fitness
routine. Watch the video below and get down to exercising with
Mokoena now!
