Although it attempted to capitalise on “Reconciliation Day” by inviting feuding celebrities to kiss and make up, fast-food chain Nando’s was left rejected when not one of the invited feuding teams took up its offer. Nando’s, well known for its flame-grilled fare, has made its mark on the advertising industry with its witty campaigns that have kept South Africans entertained. December 16 may now serve as the unofficial beginning of the festive season, as South Africans take full advantage of all the public holidays in December to maximise their leave. But the day came into effect in 1994 to foster a culture of reconciliation in the country. Nando’s released a series of funny adverts aimed at big names including singer AKA, radio host and television presenter Bonang Matheba and choreographer Somizi as the chain tried to foster a feeling of reconciliation by getting celebrity “feuds” to end and invited the celebrities to various shopping centres to reconcile over a Nando’s meal.       Unfortunately, none of the VIPs showed up, much to Nando’s dismay. Perhaps they prefer beef over chicken after all.
