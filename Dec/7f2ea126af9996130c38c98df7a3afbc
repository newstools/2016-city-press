About 8 000 pupils in Gauteng have yet to find a school for next year amid allegations that nearly 10 000 applicants have clogged the online registration system. This was revealed by Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi while addressing reporters during the 2017 academic year state of readiness media briefing at the department’s provincial headquarters this afternoon. Lesufi said this was because about 10 403 parents, who were applicants had received offers for placement of their children but had not accepted them. He said if by the end of today these applicants had not responded positively to the offers, they would be removed from the system to allocate places for those in need. “Gauteng continues to expand access to education in line with is constitutional mandate. To date, there are 2 368 264 learners enrolled in Gauteng schools. "An increase of 105 945 learners was recorded between 2015 and 2016 total enrolments. This represent an increase of 4.47%. “Rapid in-migration remains a contributing factor to the growth in learner numbers. The highest numbers of learners come from Limpopo followed by the Eastern Cape,” Lesufi said. He said his department had opted for online applications for Grades 1 and 8 to ease planning and eliminate queues at schools. Despite the initial teething problems, the objectives set for the system had largely been met, he said. In total, 310 404 applications were received online. About 176 348 were for Grade 1 and 136 056 for Grade 8. “Parents who have not yet applied for admission of their Grade 1 and Grade 8 are advised that applications for the 2017 admission are closed,” he said. Lesufi added that delivery of textbooks was in progress and additional teachers had been provided where a need had been identified.
