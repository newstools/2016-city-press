With four Grammy wins already under their belt, it comes as no surprise that the internationally acclaimed Ladysmith Black Mambazo have been nominated for the 17th time. The a cappella group were nominated in the category of best world music album for their latest CD, Walking In The Footsteps Of Our Fathers. The group members said: “With this new CD, we wanted to honour the many people from the past, people that the younger generations must give thanks to for paving the way and leaving footsteps for us to follow. We honour the past members of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, our fathers, who started this group in the 1960s.” In addition to the group’s nomination, South African born fortepianist Kristian Bezuidenhout was also nominated in the world field for best classical instrumental solo. Bezuidenhout has made a name for himself as one of the foremost artists specialising in the early pianos of fortepianos. Bezuidenhout first gained international recognition at the age of 21 after winning the prestigious first prize as well as the audience prize in the Bruges Fortepiano Competition and has previously been nominated twice for the Grammy. The 59th annual Grammy Awards ceremony is set to take place on February 12 next year at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. James Corden, host of The Late Late Show, will be hosting the prestigious music awards for the first time.
