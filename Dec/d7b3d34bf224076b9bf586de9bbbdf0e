After thousands of students enquired about applying for student funding, the National Student Financial Aid Scheme decided to reopen application processes to allow more students to apply for higher education funding in 2017. Applications will be reopened from January 9 to January 20, and the results will be made known from February 1. “Following the closing of applications, thousands of learners continued to inquire about a possible extension to the applications deadline,” said the aid scheme’s executive officer Msulwa Daca. Daca said the scheme had already received 233 470 applications, including online and mailed submissions. Social media users took to Twitter to voice their reactions, with many meting out stark criticism towards the student funder.

Other universities that increased their fees by 8% included the University of The Free State, Rhodes University, Stellenbosch University, the North-West University and the University of the Witwatersrand.
