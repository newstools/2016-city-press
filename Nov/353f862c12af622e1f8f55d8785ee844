The department of basic education has come out guns blazing after being accused of attempting to dilute the autonomy of a research unit that was set up to independently evaluate schools. Yesterday, the department released a statement in response to claims by the Democratic Alliance that the research unit was “becoming just another government department”, saying the claims were “absurd and unfounded”. The National Education Evaluation and Development Unit was set up in 2009 to analyse the state of schools, particularly the status of teaching and learning. The DA raised concerns earlier this week regarding a damning internal email from the unit’s acting chief executive Sibusiso Sithole to staff, dated September 1. The email revealed a supposedly less than independent relationship between the unit and the department.

Davis was concerned that the unit which was “supposed to be a statutory body, is becoming just another government department”. Referring to the leaked email, the department said that the email was viewed “in complete isolation from all other developments that had taken place in the process of the unit conducting its business.” The department said Davis’ claims were “ill-informed” and that the unit’s acting chief executive had personally addressed the concerns. Sithole said that the unit was accountable to the Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga for the performance of its functions.
