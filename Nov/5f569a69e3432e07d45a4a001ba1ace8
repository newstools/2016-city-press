An Mpumalanga gynaecologist has been given a four-month reprieve before he is sentenced for negligence following the death of a 23-year-old woman in 2005. Dr Danie van der Walt appeared in the Witbank Magistrates’ Court today for sentencing but the case was postponed to March 13 next year because the state wanted to present a trauma report on the woman’s mother for consideration before sentencing. The court warned Van der Walt not to leave the country and took his travelling documents. Van der Walt was found guilty of culpable homicide on September 21 this year – 11 years since Pamela Daweti died while giving birth at Cosmos Private Hospital. Daweti’s daughter, Lisakhanya, survived. The doctor’s negligence was captured in a report by chief gynaecologist Dr Mokete Titus. Titus’s report said that Daweti endured a 14-hour labour and excessive bleeding after delivering her baby while Van der Walt was away and he gave instructions to nurses over the phone. Van der Walt’s conduct, said the report, was “wholly substandard”. “Dr Van der Walt applied a vacuum extractor unsuccessfully followed by the ill-advised use of forceps,” Titus said. “[Dameti] suffered a third-degree perineal tear, which was repaired under anaesthetic in the delivery room. This was substandard as this tear must be repaired in the operating theatre under general anaesthesia,” he said. Dameti’s mother, Buyiselwa Maditjana, said outside court that her Christian faith had kept her strong over the years. “It is faith and nothing else that enabled me to persevere,” she said. Maditjana said that her daughter’s case only progressed four years after her death following the intervention of a senior prosecutor. The Health Professions Council of South Africa fined Van der Walt a R10 000 admission of guilt fine in 2007 after Titus’ report was presented before a hearing.
