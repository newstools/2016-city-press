The controversial and unconventional “Doom Prophet” has been facing an immense backlash after images surfaced of him spraying the face of his congregants with an insecticide in the “name of God”. Photos were published on the Facebook page of Lethebo Rabalago of the Mount Zion General Assembly which were then shared on social media. Doom is a product of Tiger Brands, which released a statement yesterday warning against its use on humans. “We find this practice alarming and extremely concerning, and want to make it very clear that it is unsafe to spray Doom Super Multi Insect Killer, or any other aerosol spray for that matter, into people’s faces,” Tiger Brands said. The company said they would be contacting the “person responsible to ask him to refrain from such practice”. Rabalago said that he uses Doom insect killer to heal people with cancer, HIV or any other illness, as well as to drive out demons. This is not the first pastor to make headlines for a bizarre or unsafe practice. Last year, it emerged that a pastor in Soshanguve, Prophet Penuel Mnguni of Ends of Times Disciples Ministries fed his congregants snakes and rats. This year, the “Snake Pastor” once again found himself in the spotlight after running over his congregants with cars and sticking members into a deepfreeze for 30 minutes. And then there is self-professed prophet Pastor Mboro, who established the Incredible Happenings Ministries congregation, who has been accused of sexually assaulting women during church services while promising them miracle cures. Rabalago’s congregants have declined to lay charges against and it is unclear on how the authorities will proceed. Meanwhile, social media has been buzzing with commentary about the incident.
