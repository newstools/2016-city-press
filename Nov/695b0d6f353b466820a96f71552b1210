Aaron Moloisi is well known for co-presenting educational programme Shift on SABC1, from Monday to Thursday. He recently graced our big screens as a lawyer on the film Queen Katwe. He tells City Press about rubbing shoulders with Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong’o. How did it feel to be featured on Queen Katwe? It was such a great experience and an honour to be part of the film. To me it was a dream come true, I couldn’t believe it, to be part of the Hollywood movie and to represent South Africa as a whole. It was an amazing experience! What have you learnt from your role? I have learnt a lot, especially how Hollywood actors behave on set. I had to give my best and people are so chilled. I was so close to the director. How did it feel working alongside a star like Lupita Nyong’o? I have always been a fan of hers, so I must say I was star-struck. I felt like a child around her. She is one of the sweetest and we had a great time working together. Any projects in the pipeline? I have a show that is coming and I’m the executive producer of it. The show called Arie’s Choice, produced by Moloisi Media house, will be aired on SABC2. It is going to be an interesting and educational show for the viewers.
