The University of Johannesburg has provided counselling for students and family members after the death of three students this weekend. Two students died while attending an awards and teambuilding event near Pretoria, and another was shot dead in Johannesburg in the early hours of Saturday morning. The student, who resided in a private residence, was shot by an unknown assailant. Initial reports suggested that the first-year BSc computer science and informatics student was shot by a security guard, but Africa Housing Company (Afhco) has denied these claims. Afhco said that initial reports suggested that an altercation took place between a group of students and an individual after a year-end party held at the building at 81 Rissik Street, in the inner city of Johannesburg. “The individual, unknown to Afhco, appears to have entered the property at the same time as security guards employed by SNG Security. The private security company was contracted to place two uniformed and unarmed security guards at the party. Afhco prohibits all security guards from carrying any weapons on its properties. It is unclear why the individual was armed,” Afhco said. The incident is being investigated by the South African Police Service. In a separate incident, two University of Johannesburg students drowned over the weekend while river rafting at Intundla Game Lodge and Bush Spa near Pretoria. Forty four students were attending an awards and teambuilding event organised by a UJ day house. Eight students acted in their own capacity to go river rafting, which was not on the official programme. It is believed the raft capsized and the two students drowned. The University of Johannesburg management has met with the families to express their condolences and has undertaken to assist them with the funeral arrangements. They are also providing counselling to the students and families of all three students died this weekend.
