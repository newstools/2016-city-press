The search for a three-year-old girl who is still missing following devastating flash floods was put on hold due to heavy rains. Rescue missions were suspended earlier today after heavy rains interrupted the search for the young girl along the Jukskei River in Alexandra, Emergency Management Services (EMS) said. A team of rescuers including paramedics, South African Police Service divers, National Disaster Management, Johannesburg Metro Police Department and EMS have been carrying out the search since little Everite went missing after flash floods hit the area on Wednesday evening. Everiteâ€™s father, Shadrick Chauke, was trying to escape the raging waters of the river by climbing a tree. The branch he was holding on to snapped and Everite slipped from his grasp and was quickly swept away by the stream. Many fatalities have been reported since the floods swept over most of Johannesburg and the East Rand. Johannesburg mayoral spokesperson Tony Taverna-Turisan said six fatalities across Gauteng, including two in Linksfield, had been linked to the floods. There have been mixed reports of the total number of deaths, with Gauteng Weather service claiming seven deaths have been recorded. Scores of people are still missing. One man allegedly died after being hit by lightning in Vanderbijlpark. Reports say the man, in his 30s, was sheltering under a tree during a thunderstorm on Thursday afternoon, when he was struck. Meanwhile a number of warnings have been issued as storms are set to continue until tomorrow evening. Storms have ripped through Johannesburg since Wednesday with many houses, businesses and public roads affected. The lower basement of OR Tambo International Airport also fell victim to floods with many flights affected too. Many took to social media sharing thoughts, images and video showing just how much damage was caused.          JHB - #FLOODING #Benoni RT @PeeMoTraffic Tom Jones update.
