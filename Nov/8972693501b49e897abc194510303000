A meeting is under way between the ANC’s national working committee and the long-serving members regarding the current vision of the party. A group of more than 100 ANC stalwarts and long-serving members, have expressed concern about the future of the party and the country. They took a public stance under the banner “For the sake of our future”. The 101 signatories said that, collectively and as individuals, they had tried to engage President Jacob Zuma and the ANC’s other top five officials, through the office of the secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, in the belief that they could contribute to correcting many of the “ills befallen our organisation”. The signatories of the “For the sake of our future” met with the ANC, including Zuma and Mantashe at 12pm today. “We are looking forward to a positive and frank engagement with the national working committee of our party and believe that this engagement should not only remain simply an internal party issue, given the gravity of the situation and the negative impact it has not only on South African opinion but our place in the international community,” For the Sake of Our Future said earlier today. Mantashe and other senior party members have expressed their support for a wider dialogue surrounding the veterans and stalwarts. “No honest person or citizen in South Africa will be afraid of honest criticism offered in a constructive manner and the need for honest introspection,” For the Sake of Our Future said. Previously the stalwarts received backlash for voicing their concerns on the issues within the ANC. The 101 signatories are: 1. Kathrada Ahmed 2. Goldberg Denis 3. Mlangeni Andrew 4.
