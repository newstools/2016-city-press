An SA Air Force AgustaWestland A109 light utility helicopter crashed in the Free State while on a night training flight this week – the fifth incident involving this newly acquired fleet from the Italians in the controversial 1999 Strategic Defence Package, or the so-called arms deal. The SA National Defence Force’s corporate communications head Siphiwe Dlamini confirmed the incident, saying while they were concerned about the incident, at least all three occupants survived the crash. Defence spokesperson Brigadier General Xolani Mabanga said a board of inquiry had been convened to determine the cause of the accident. “Three members were on board the helicopter during the incident and they were undertaking a routine night exercise. They suffered minor injuries and have since been discharged from 3 Military Hospital.” The rotary-winged aircraft was on the inventory of 87 Helicopter Flying School at Air Force Base Bloemspruit. According to reports, the helicopter crashed on the Umpukane farm in the Clocolan area. Another of these Italian-designed helicopters, assigned to 19 Squadron at Air Force Base Hoedspruit, crashed in the Kruger National Park three years ago, killing all five occupants. The accident was primarily due to pilot error. Since entering service with the SA Air Force, the A109, purchased to replace the Alouette III, has experienced several crashes and incidents. Three crew members were killed in May 2009 when their helicopter crashed into the Woodstock Dam near Bergville in KwaZulu-Natal. A further two helicopters were damaged in November and December 2010, with no loss of life. The Woodstock Dam incident was ruled to have been due to pilot error, while the 2010 incidents were due to tail rotor failure and a broken swash plate control rod. The technical problems were subsequently fixed. A total of 30 A109s were delivered from 2005 under Project Flange. The most recent crash leaves 25 airframes in service. – Additional reporting by DefenceWeb
