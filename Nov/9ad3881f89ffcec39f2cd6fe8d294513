   During Thursday’s session of the National Assembly Democratic Alliance chief whip John Steenhuisen, raised the issue on a point of privilege and expressed concern over journalists and the public being denied access to the meeting this week. Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson quickly objected, and told Steenhuisen that she wasn’t responsible for the decision. At the meeting on Tuesday, chairperson Fikile Majola announced it would be a closed meeting due to fears that “commercially sensitive information” may be revealed during a presentation by PetroSA’ on its R14.5 billion losses the previous year. This meant that a presentation by the department of energy on the nuclear build programme that was also scheduled for this meeting, would be behind closed doors. Mbete said she would take up the issue with Cedrick Frolick, House chairperson of the National Assembly.

DA MP Gordon Mackay said it was “unacceptable to have Parliament closing meetings when such an important issue, clearly in the national public interest, is being discussed”. “There is overwhelming public interest in the nuclear build programme, which South Africa does not need and cannot afford. This is precisely why Parliament must ensure real and meaningful oversight at this critical time,” he said. “Secrecy leads to corruption that steals from the poor, and allows for politicians and their cronies to benefit from public money.”
