President Jacob Zuma said he has reprimanded Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane for irregularly issuing a statement on behalf of Cabinet more than two months ago. Zuma reveals this, but nothing more, in a written parliamentary reply to queries about Zwane’s controversial statement on September 1. Zwane stirred up a political storm by saying that Cabinet had resolved to ask President Jacob Zuma to establish a judicial inquiry into the banks that had broken ties with the Gupta family. He also said there would be a review of the legislation that governs the banking system. Both Cabinet and Zuma distanced themselves from Zwane’s statement, saying it had been issued in his personal capacity, not on behalf of Cabinet or a task team. Zwane’s rogue statement prompted calls for him to be fired, but Zuma said he was deciding what steps should be taken. Now in written replies to the DA’s David Maynier, Zuma distanced himself once again from Zwane’s statement. Asked by Maynier why Zwane had later insisted that the statement was not in his personal capacity, Zuma replied that he was not in a position to answer. “The question in this regard must be directed to the minister. “I reprimanded the minister for the statement,” said Zuma without elaborating.
