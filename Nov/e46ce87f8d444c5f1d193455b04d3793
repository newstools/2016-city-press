Following a month of protest action by employees of Tiger Beverages, a division of Tiger Brands, an agreement has been reached and workers are expected to return to work next week. Last Friday 440 workers marched peacefully to the Tiger Brands head office in Bryanston to hand over a memorandum of demands which included the increase in salaries, an increase in housing and travel allowances and the call for 15 seasonal workers who have been working for the company for 10 years or more to be made permanent. Today, Katishi Masemola of the Food And Allied Worker’s Union announced that worker’s have agreed on an 8% wage increment increase, a 10.77% increase in housing and travelling allowance and that the 15 seasonal workers will be made permanent. “We take this opportunity to salute our members for such a brave strike action in pursuit of their demands, especially on permanent employment of workers and allowances on critical issues of traveling and housing given how expensive is the cost of transport and the dire shortage of decent shelter in this country,” Masemola said.
