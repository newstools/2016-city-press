President Jacob Zuma has accepted the resignation letter of two more SABC board members, who tendered them this weekend. “President Jacob Zuma has received and accepted the resignations of Vuyo Mhlakaza and Dr Aaron Tshidzumba as members of the Board of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, with immediate effect. The president has thanked the two former board members for their contribution during their tenure at the SABC and wished them well in all their future endeavours,” the Presidency said this morning. The resignations came ahead of the inquiry which is set to begin today into the board of the public broadcaster. The only remaining non-executive member was its chairperson, Mbulaheni Maghuve. The inquiry will be overseen by the parliamentary ad hoc committee that was appointed by the National Assembly, to analyse the role the board plays and if it is still in fact fit to do its job. On October 5, Krish Naidoo and Vusi Mavuso announced their resignations at a meeting with Parliament’s communications committee. The board needs a minimum of nine members to form a quorum. Meanwhile at the ad hoc committee meeting today on the inquiry into the SABC board, MPs mentioned the two resignations. Committee chairperson Vincent Smith said that they hadn’t received official confirmation and would wait until they had the resignation letters. Hearings into the SABC board would start on November 29. Smith says the committee will sit right through to the December 9 when Parliament rises, and would even work “on Christmas Day if needs be”.
