The World Bank Group last month released it's ranking of which countries are most conducive to starting and operating a business. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business, from 1â€“190. A high ease of doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the starting and operation of a local firm. The rankings are determined by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores on 10 topics, each consisting of several indicators, giving equal weight to each topic.
