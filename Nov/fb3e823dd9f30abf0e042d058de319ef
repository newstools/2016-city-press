After Hlaudi Motsoeneng was reinstated at the SABC as the group executive of corporate affairs, he brazenly told the media that all protocol was followed during the process of his reinstatement. He also said that he would apply for his previous position as chief operating officer, and that he “will get the job”. Communications Minister Faith Muthambi has responded to parliamentary questions posed to her by the Democratic Alliance, conceding that the positions were not advertised and there was no need to do so. According to the DA, when asked whether the two positions were advertised externally before the appointments of Motsoeneng as group executive of corporate affairs and Bessi Tugwana as chief operating officer, Minister Muthambi responded saying: “No, the positions of group executive of corporate affairs and chief operating officer were not advertised. There was no need to advertise the position of chief operating officer, as Tugwana is acting in this position. Motsoeneng was reinstated to the position he occupied prior to his appointment as the chief operating officer.” DA member of Parliament Phumzile van Damme has questioned why the position of chief operating officer has not been advertised when the position of chief executive was advertised on October 2. “The DA will ensure this matter is addressed and our questions answered during hearings of the ad hoc committee on the SABC inquiry due to begin on November 29,” Van Damme said.
