Bafana Bafana have been rocked by Tokelo Rantie's no-show ahead of Saturday's opening 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifier against Burkina Faso. As a result he has been withdrawn from the team. According to the South African Football Association's (Safa) website: "Rantie was scheduled to report for duty on Sunday, October 2, but failed to do so although he had already arrived in South Africa from overseas." The striker again failed to meet the team the next day and the management decided to leave for the west African nation without him. This is not the first time the 26-year-old striker has left the team stranded. He did the same last year when he failed to pitch up for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations opener against Gambia because he was getting married. The statement also quoted coach Shakes Mashaba as saying "we thought in the spirit of encouraging team spirit and discipline, we must release Rantie from camp". The Genclerbirligi striker will now face the wrath of Safa because the association will handle the matter.
