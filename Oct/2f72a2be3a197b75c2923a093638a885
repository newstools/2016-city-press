Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has received some more support – this time from the respected organisations Freedom under Law and The Helen Suzman Foundation, who have called for the charges to be withdrawn. The two entities have sent a letter – titled “Urgent steps to stop the madness” – to the National Prosecuting Authority. In it, they express their extreme displeasure at the manner in which Gordhan has been treated. “Ordinarily one does not comment on the merits of pending court cases. But we cannot stand by while untold damage is being done to the reputation and stability of our country following the shocking allegations levelled at the minister of finance and the theatrical manner in which they were broadcast earlier this week,” they said. The two organisations have called for the charges against Gordhan to be withdrawn immediately. They said they had the charges analysed, and concluded that “they are on the face of it legally flawed and factually unfounded.”    “Your conduct in pressing baseless charges against the minister of finance has, and continues to have, devastating consequences for the republic and its economy. This is a matter of paramount public interest and our clients intend to review and set aside your decisions to institute the charges against the minister of finance, under the constitutional principal of legality and otherwise, unless you withdraw the decisions to furnish a cogent basis for the actions taken.” The letter was delivered to the NPA this morning calling for the withdrawal of the charges against the minister and, failing that, for delivery of certain documents and details with a view to urgent proceedings to stop the prosecution.
