Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim Shakes Mashaba has paid homage to defender Eric Mathoho, who has decided to remain in the camp despite losing his brother. While sending his condolences to the Mathoho family for their loss, Mashaba said the defender has been strong and was raring to go in the 2018 Fifa World Cup opening qualifier against Burkina Faso on Saturday. “We were ready to release him but he said his brother would have loved to see him playing hence he decided to stay with the team. This means a lot for us as we need him. He has been in touch with the family from here to check what is happening,” said Mashaba. Mathoho is expected to play in the heart of defense after recovering from an injury. The defender returns to the national side after missing out on the two matches against Mauritania and Egypt earlier this month as he was still recovering from the injury he sustained at the Rio Olympics Games. No further details on the death of his brother were available at the time of publication.
