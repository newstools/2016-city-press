Following his weeks of absence from council meetings and all ANC activities in the Nelson Mandela Bay, Danny Jordaan has resigned from his position as leader of the opposition in council. News of Jordaan’s resignation broke in the inner circle of the Port Elizabeth region of the ANC this morning. Nelson Mandela Bay region ANC head of communications, Gift Ngqondi, confirmed that Jordaan would be officially announcing his resignation as party leader in council at a press conference at 2.30pm. After the ANC’s loss to the Democratic Alliance in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality in the recent local government elections, the question most often posed in council is: Where is Danny Jordaan? Jordaan was deployed by the ANC to Nelson Mandela Bay in June 2015 to serve as executive mayor, after the regional executive committee was disbanded in January that year. Since the ANC’s election defeat, the municipality has held three council meetings in the now DA-led municipality. But Jordaan has been absent from all of them. Ngqondi would not give full details on the matter, but confirmed the resignation. “All the details on comrade Jordaan’s resignation will be given later, in a media briefing to make the official announcement,” said Ngqondi. Council speaker Jonathan Lawack said he had not yet received the official resignation from Jordaan. “I am aware of his resignation, but officially have not received any official documents to that effect,” said Lawack. Acting city manager Johann Mettler confirmed the resignation. “I can confirm that Danny Jordaan resigned as councillor of Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. A vacancy will be registered with the IEC shortly,” said Mettler.
