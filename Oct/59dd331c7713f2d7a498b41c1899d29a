Inflation in September was once again higher than the official target range of 3% to 6%, making it very likely that the South African Reserve Bank will raise interest rates next month. Statistics South Africa’s Consumer Price Index for last month puts headline inflation at 6.1%. Food, housing and utilities remain the major culprits with the index for food and beverages at 11.6% higher than a year before. Bread and cereals were 16.6% more expensive than in September 2015 and fruit prices rose by an astonishing 25%. Prices for sugar, sweets and desserts rose by 21.4%. As is usually the case when food drives overall inflation, poor people are seeing their cost of living escalate faster than the relatively rich. Statistics South Africa’s sub-index for the poorest 20% of the population showed inflation of 8.1% compared with the 5.9% experienced by the top 20%. The top 20% however includes all households spending more than R142 000 per year. There is an expectation that the inflation rate should keep edging higher towards the end of this year, but start falling next year – mostly because of the high base for prices set early this year by the rand’s crash following Nenegate. A lot of the country’s inflation is imported through the exchange rate’s effect on the price of fuel. » Are you being affected by the increasing rise of the prices of food, housing and utilities?
