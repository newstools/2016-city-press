Following his huge #FillUpTheDome event, he is doing it again. On 
Friday afternoon, rapper Cassper Nyovest managed to squeeze us into his busy 
schedule. City Press got in touch with the rapper just a few hours before his 
#FillUpOrlandoStadium concert. It has been weeks that I’ve been preparing myself for the concert. I’ve been going to gym for three months to get fit for my performance. I’m so 
excited about this event and I am so grateful for the support from my 
fans. Everybody has nerves, but I am confident about the concert. I have 
received so much support from all the artists and my fans from all over the 
country. I would also like to thank all the sponsors and all the departments for 
their support. The list is long. I have Nadia Nakai and Gemini Major, Nasty C, 
Riky Rick, Major League, DJ Fresh, Tira – the list goes on. It’s going to be a big surprise for my fans and all my supporters, 
trust me.
