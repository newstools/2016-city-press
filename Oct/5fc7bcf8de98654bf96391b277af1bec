The Twitterverse woke up to photos ranging from racy to unpublishable being posted on the popular social media site as women (and some men) around the world ditched their bras and bared their breasts in support of #NoBraDay. Febe Meyer, marketing manager of the Pink Drive, told City Press that although #NoBraDay is not a local campaign, it does help to create awareness around breast cancer. National No Bra Day, which originally started in the UK, is rooted in raising awareness for breast cancer awareness month. “It’s just a pity that it should take this kind of a thing to egg people on to get tested for breast cancer and to look after themselves. People should be going for regular checkups anyway,” she said. Some users on Twitter have been posting topless selfies of themselves, with others saying how people should not lose focus of what the day is really about.  A woman is not her breast, breasts can be taken away, the courage to fight for life is is a woman's strength #NoBraDay As part of breast cancer awareness month, the Pink Drive has been running a fundraising “selfie” campaign for October. “What people have to do is take a ‘selfie’ of themselves, and text the word ‘selfie’ to 40158 to donate R20 to the PinkDrive. They will then receive a link where they can upload their selfies,” she said. The Pink Drive dispels some of the following myths on their website about breast cancer: Cancer is a disease of the wealthy and developed countries. False: Anyone can get cancer, no matter who you are or where you live. Only old people get cancer. False: You can get cancer at any age. The youngest girl in South Africa reported with breast cancer was 6 years old. Cancer is a death sentence. False: If detected early, the cancer can be cured. Cancer is my fate. False: Cancer is a disease that can affect everyone. We must not talk about cancer. False: We must talk about cancer and by talking about it, you are making other people aware of it.
