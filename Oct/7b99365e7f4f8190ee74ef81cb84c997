A Johannesburg man who identified himself only as Peter is nearing the second day of his one-man picket against the decision to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with fraud. Brandishing his “Hands off Pravin, arrest Zupta” placard at passing motorists on busy Barry Hertzog Avenue in the northern Johannesburg suburb of Emmarentia, the man – who is a contractor at one of the country’s parastatals – said: “This is the least I can do.” "Zupta" is a contraction of "Zuma" and "Gupta", and alludes to the relationship between the president and the Gupta family. Peter, who said he was an activist involved in the fight against apartheid in the 1980s, added: “I didn’t struggle for this rubbish. “We could have spent the thousands and thousands of rands which were stolen on free education for students. These people want the economy to tank.” So far, Peter says he’s received lots of support from passing motorists. “Aside from one guy who gave me the middle finger and one who shouted expletives,” he said. “Most have been hooting, waving and clapping.”
