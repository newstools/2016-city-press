Mamelodi Sundowns players have received death threats on their social media accounts ahead of the second leg of the CAF Champions League final against Zamalek on Sunday. But Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has downplayed the seriousness of the threats, arguing they were intimidating tactics from people claiming to be supporters. “I know a number of our players have been receiving messages from their supporters but I told my players not to worry about them. They have been sent messages on their social media accounts – Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. You know it is easy to find players on these platforms because they are active but it should not worry us. We know how people mobilise on social media after what happened in the Tahrir Square. It is a way of unsettling our players,” said Mosimane. Sundowns beat the Egyptian giants 3-0 in the first leg last weekend and are 90 minutes away from claiming the continental glory Sundowns were visited by minister of sport and recreation Fikile Mbalula at their training ground in Chloorkop before their departure to Egypt. Mbalula said he was confident the club would do the country proud by lifting the trophy. The second leg kicks off at 8.30pm South African time on Sunday evening.
