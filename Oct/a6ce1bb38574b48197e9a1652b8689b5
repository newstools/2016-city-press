A case of attempted murder has been opened after a student was shot 
in the leg at the Tshwane University of Technology. According to Brigadier Sally de Beer, Sanele Mathebula was 
allegedly shot by a private security guard using a shot gun with live 
ammunition. It is alleged that the shot gun went off by mistake. Students on the ground said it looked like shotgun pellets. De Beer said 11 shotguns were seized from the private security 
guards thereafter. The incident occurred during protests at the Pretoria West Campus 
which started earlier today. A scuffle ensued between students and police earlier today. Students torched a security guard house and a nyala during their 
protests.  According to University spokesperson Willa de Ruiter private 
security on campus is from Fidelity and Nationwide. The university and police are investigating the matter. After a line-up the guard was not identified and still hasn’t been 
found although students have referred to him as “Mr Twala”.
