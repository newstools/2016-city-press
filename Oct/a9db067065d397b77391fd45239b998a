President Jacob Zuma has declined to meet Public Protector Thuli Madonsela as expected today for her probe into the Gupta family’s alleged state capture. Instead, Zuma asked her to supply him with a list of witnesses, to give him the opportunity to interview these witnesses, and undertake to not issue a report before he has done so. Madonsela’s term ends on Friday. During an interview yesterday, Madonsela told the SABC that Zuma had agreed to meet with her today on the matter. However, Zuma wrote to Madonsela today, and said that he would not participate in the investigation until Madonsela had given his lawyers a list of all the witnesses who had implicated him.  In an unusual step, Zuma said that he wanted to question all those who had implicated him. Zuma asked her to provide the undertaking before close of business tomorrow. Madonsela has been committed to completing a preliminary report on state capture before her term ends
