Today Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane addressed her role as the new Public Protector as she steers the reins of the Public Protector’s office forward. “I have previously had a short spell here as a senior investigator, so returning here felt like a homecoming,” she said. The Public Protector took up her role in office on Monday and has had a busy week filled with meetings and acquainting herself with the staff. She said that she was looking forward to serving the people of the country without fear or favour and she was “thankful to South Africa for entrusting me with this responsibility”. The determined advocate also thanked President Jacob Zuma for appointing her as the country’s fourth Public Protector. Despite her impressive law background, Mkhwebane was cognisant of the challenges that still had to be tackled. “There is no doubt that a mammoth task lies ahead for me and my team,” she said. Mkhwebane hit the ground running this week, beginning her week with an introduction to the staff of the Public Protector’s office. “I have not come here to lead alone. I will walk side by side in pursuit of a shared vision,” she said, speaking of the important role that everyone played within the institution. Mkhwebane said she intended scheduling a meeting with the labour union in order to address and resolve staff issues. Yesterday, Mkhwebane made her first official address in Parliament on the institution’s annual report. She reiterated in today’s briefing that R5.5 million was found to be irregular expenditure, of which the use of consultants was a major contributing factor. She has vowed to no longer use consultants or donor funding. “The government should be funding us so that we don’t depend on other countries for funding,” she said.
