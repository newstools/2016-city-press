Collen “Oros” Maine’s dramatic comments at Saturday’s march, where he called the MK veterans to take up arms for President Jacob Zuma, have landed him in hot water with both the ANC and the DA. After Maine’s comments, which were labelled “unfortunate, irresponsible and reckless” by the ANC, the Democratic Alliance Youth is set to lay criminal charges against the ANC Youth League president. The DA’s student organisation leader Yusuf Cassim said that the charges would be laid against him for inciting violence. “Maine’s statements are dangerous, callous and irresponsible,” Cassim said. “They are in direct contravention with the Constitution, which states that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which ... does not extend to propaganda for war; incitement of imminent violence; or advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.” Cassim said that his comments were “an insult to our constitutional democracy and they deserve the strongest possible condemnation.” The DA youth called on the South African Police Services and the National Prosecuting Authority to investigate the matter. The ANC released a statement today saying that the comments made by Maine were viewed as “unfortunate, irresponsible and reckless”. The ANC said that the freedom which was enjoyed in South Africa today came at a price. “Among those freedoms is the right to freedom of expression, which does not extend to inflammatory remarks such as those made by the youth league president and should never be allowed to find a space in our democratic society.” Cassim told City Press that the DA youth were currently in talks with their lawyers and the charges should be instituted either later today or tomorrow.
