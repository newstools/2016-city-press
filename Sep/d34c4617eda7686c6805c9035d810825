It’s been another busy day for the #FeesMustFall protest. From the Wits poll results to lecturers demonstrating how to carry out a peaceful protest to the security cluster saying that police are not getting enough credit for not using live ammunition. We round up five of the most interesting developments that occured today. 1. Wits Poll results #FeesMustFall protesters at the University of the Witwatersrand were vastly outvoted during a poll on whether or not to keep the institution closed. The majority of Wits students (77%, or 16 739) voted in favour of proceeding with their regular programme, with only 4991 (23%) preferring that the university remain closed. 2.
