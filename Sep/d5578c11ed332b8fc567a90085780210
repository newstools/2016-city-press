Boitumelo “Boity” Thulo is set to add “fashionista” to her long list of talents. The television personality launched her much publicised BoityXSissyBoy collection – a first-of-its-kind collaboration for the brand – on Thursday night. The glam event was held at the Turbine Hall in Newtown, Joburg, and was attended by family members, friends and celebs who were spotted rocking some of the garments on display. These included Khanya Mkangisa, Uyanda Mbuli, and emcee for the night, Nomuzi “Moozlie” Mabena. Other well-known guests included TV personality and model Jonathan Boynton-Lee and Maps Maponyane. Thulo is no stranger to working with A-list fashion brands. Just last year she collaborated with LEGiT to release a sexy spring range. Of the new collection, she said she was “incredibly excited, but also honoured, as this is a new concept that has never been done before by Sissy Boy”. The collection is inspired by Thulo’s fashion sense and personal style. It comprises three “capsule collections”, to be revealed between September and December. Thulo revealed that her collaboration with Sissy Boy would last for three years. She said fans should expect the new collection to be sexy, yet comfortable. “I’m all about being sexy, celebrating those curves and, of course, I’m big into comfort, so that’s what I’ve tried to bring across in the range.” Boity explained that she had been a part of the design process from start to finish. “This is my attempt at being a fashionista because I have been 100% involved. From choosing fabrics to colours and everything,” she said.
