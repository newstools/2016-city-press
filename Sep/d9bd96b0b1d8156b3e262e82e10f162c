The SABC board must immediately recall the appointment of Hlaudi Motsoeneng as the group executive of corporate affairs at the broadcaster. Jackson Mthembu, ANC chief whip, said this today at a press conference at the ANC’s offices at Parliament. He said that the developments at the public broadcaster were causing serious embarrassment – not only for the SABC but for the country. “The appointment of the corporation’s former chief operations officer, whose previous appointment was also set aside by the courts, is without a doubt the last straw that breaks the camel’s back.” Mthembu said the reappointment was a violation of both the Supreme Court and appeal court’s rulings. This indicates management that has no respect for the rule of law. The decision is illegal and the board has a responsibility to meet and recall it immediately, he said. Mthembu said the SABC board was due to be called to appear before the communications portfolio committee next Wednesday. The committee will thus be convened while Parliament is on a constituency break, set to re-open on October 11.
