Unlawful, the straw that breaks the camel’s back, a board that is “failing spectacularly” – ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu had a few choice words for Hlaudi Motsoeneng and the SABC today. Mthembu told journalists that Parliament would be failing in its responsibility if it allowed the “deteriorating situation” at the SABC to continue. Here are some of the best quotes from his no-holds-barred speech: 1. “The shenanigans that have been unfolding at the SABC only serve to distract the public broadcaster from discharging its core public service mandate.” 2. Motsoeneng’s appointment as SABC group executive of corporate affairs after his previous appointment was also set aside by the courts, “is without a doubt the last straw that breaks the camel’s back.” The board didn’t get off scot-free. 3. “It is clear that this board is failing spectacularly to exercise its fiduciary obligation to steer the organisation.” 4. “We will recommend that Parliament institute an inquiry into the fitness of the current board members to lead the public broadcaster.” 5. He said Supreme Court of Appeal’s judgment last Monday – in which it dismissed Motsoeneng’s bid to appeal a November 2015 Western Cape High Court ruling declaring his appointment as chief operations officer irrational and set it aside – should have put the matter to bed. “But it looks like it is far from being put to bed,” he said.
